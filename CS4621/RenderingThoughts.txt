Initial Tasks:
--Implement Cook-Torrence Shading
--Implement simple fibers
--Use specular texture mapping
--Implement anisotropic sub-surface reflection with fibers

Later tasks:
--Create more accurate fiber generation, randomness
--Tune all the parameters, a lot
--Attempt multiple types of wood

Extra tasks:
--Implement knots in wood

And later, for something completely different:
--Metal. Research, do it.
